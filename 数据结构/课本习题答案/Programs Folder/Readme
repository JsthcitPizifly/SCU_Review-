Code examples for the book "A Practical Introduction to Data
Structures and ALgorithm Analysis, 2nd Edition"
by Clifford A. Shaffer.

This directory contains the raw source for the code examples from the
book, along with various drivers, testors, and other scaffolding for
those examples.  Note that the code examples in the book are (usually)
inserted directly from the files in this directory, in an effort to
insure correctness of the code examples.  This necessitates what might
appear to be odd decomposition of the code files.  In general, there
are three types of code files: .s, .h, and .x files.  .x files are
code fragments that actually appear in the book.  .h files are normal
.h files for C++.  .s files are parts of source code that must be put
together to form the full sourcecode files.  The script "setup" will
put the various pieces together, ready for compilation.  In addition,
the combined pieces are what a person should be looking at to
understand the implementations.
